<span style="color:red"> **Jupyter notebooks:**</span>

- cell-based web interface used for programming
- New cells are code cells by default and program counter increments when a code is executed
- important to save regularly [command + save] to not lose progress
- run button is used to execute the current cell, can also run by pressing [shift + return]
- Interactive quizzes are used for active learning & to enhance understanding

<span style="color:red"> **Python Programming Basics:**</span>

<span style="color:green"> **2 Ways to get Output on the screen:**</span>
1. Print statement
   
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

2. Last line echo

```python
message = "This is a last line echo.
print(message)
```

<span style="color:blue"> **Variable Assignment:**</span>

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHAT does variable assignment mean:**</span>
* **answer 1:** Process of storing a value in a variable. Allows us to give a name to a value and use that name to refer to the value thorughout the program. 

<span style="color:indigo"> **HOW do we apply variable assignment?**</span>
* **answer 2:** Follow these steps:
* 1. **Understand concept of variable assignment**, which is the process of assigning value to a variable. In Python, you can assign values to variables using assignment operator (=).
  2. **Choose variable name:** A name that is descriptive and meaningful. Can contain letters, numbers, but cannot start with number or contain spaces.
  3. **Assign a value to the variable:** Use assignment operator (=) to assign value to your variable. Value can be of any data type, i.e.) integers, text strings, or floating-point numbers.
 
 ```python
 x=10 #assigns the integer value 10 the variable `x`
```

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHY do we use this?**</span>
* **answer 3:** It is used to store and manipulate data. They are used to hold values and can be referenced and modified throughout a program. Reasons we use:
* 1. **Flexibility & Reusability**: allows us to store and reuse values across different parts of our program. Instead of hard-coding a value multiple times, we can assign it a variable and use that variable whenever we need it.
  2. **Data Manipulation**: Enables us to perform calculations and manipulate data. Can assign values to variables and use operators and functions to perform operations on those variables. Allows us to perform complex computations and process data in a more organized and efficient manner.
  3. **Readability**: Variables with descriptive names can make our code more readable and understandable. This makes it easier for other programmers (ourselves included) to understand and modify the code.
  4. **Dynamic Typing**: Not having to declare the type of a varaible explicitly. Variables can hold different types of values at different points in the program. Flexibility allows us to create more versatile and adaptable code.
  5. **Code Organization**: Helps in organizing our code by giving meaningful names to different values. We can group related values together and clearly express their purpose. Improves overall readability and maintainability of our code. 

  
```python
my_variable = 1 # `my_variable` is a variable

#This defines another variable
other_var = `variables are lit`
another_var = "this is also text"

#once you create a variable it's stored in your namespace
my_variable
```

```python
a = 29
a = `string`
print(a)
```
<span style="color:pink"> **After executing following code, what is the value of a?"**</span>
* **answer:** string

  
<span style="color:green"> **Reminder: Code Variables != Math Variables**</span>
* In mathematics: `=` refers to equality (statement of truth)
* In coding: `=` refers to assignment

<span style="color:blue"> **Reserved Words:**</span>
* There are 33 words not allowed to be used for variable assignment in Python >3.6
* 1. False
  2. class
  3. finally
  4. is
  5. return
  6. None
  7. continue
  8. for
  9. lambda
  10. try
  11. True
  12. def
  13. from
  14. nonlocal
  15. while
  16. and
  17. del
  18. global
  19. not
  20. with
  21. as
  22. elif
  23. if
  24. or
  25. yield
  26. assert
  27. else
  28. import
  29. pass
  30. break
  31. except
  32. in
  33. raise
 
  * Using a reserved word as a variable assignment will break Python
  * Names are always left of `=`, values are always on right
  * Names are case sensitive
  

<span style="color:blue"> **Variable Types**</span>

| Variable Type | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| String (str) | store characters, as text |
| Integer (int) | store signed, whole numbers |
| Float (float) | store signed, decimal-point numbers |
| Booleans (bool) | store `True` or `False` (capitalization matters) |
| None (NoneType) | special type that stores `None`, used to denote a null or empty value. |
| Lists (list) & Tuples (tup) | collection of ordered items, that can be of mixed type (lists are mutable; tuples are immutable) |
| Dictionaries (dict) | mutable collection of items, that can be of mixed-type, that are stored as key-value pairs. |

```python
# Declare a variable
variable_name = 1.342
variable_name2 = 3
variable_name3 = [1,3,5, 'crap', None, 4.242]

# Some Notes
# 1.342 is an example of a floating number
# 3 is an example of an integer
# None is a none type
# [1,3,5] is an example of a list

# You can always ask Python 'what type is this variable' using:
type(variable_name)
type(variable_name2)
type(variable_name3)
```

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHAT does variable types mean:**</span>
* **answer 1:** refers to the various categories or classifications of data that can be stored in a variable in a programming language. Can hold different types of values, i.e.) integers, texts, strings, floating-point numbers, boolean values, etc.

<span style="color:indigo"> **HOW do we apply variable types?**</span>
* **answer 2:** Steps to apply variable types:
* 1. **Specify type at time of declaration**
 ```python
my_variable = 10
```
Here, `my_variable` is an integer variable with a value of 10. 

  2. **Change the type during runtime:** Unlike other programming languages like Java and C, Python allows you to change the type of variable during runtime. I.e.) you can assign a different type of value to a variable that was previously assigned a different type of value.

```python
my_variable = 10 # my_variable is an integer
my_variable = "Hello" # Now my_variable is a string
```
Here, 'my_variable` starts as an integer and then gets assigned a string value. 

  3. **Be cautious with the assignment operator:** It's important to note taht the assignment operator (`=`) used in programming is not the same as the mathematical equal sign. Assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable, while the equal sign in mathematics reps equality. When applying variable types, ensure to use the assignment operator correctly.

  4. **Use descriptive variable names:** Crucial to avoid reserved words in Python programming langauage as variable names. Reserved words are words that have special meanings in Python and cannot be used as variable names.
  5. **Default types in Python:** Python has default types for variables. When you assign a value enclosed in quotes to a vriable, Python assumes it to be a string. If you assign a whole number to a variable, Python assumes it to be an integer. Python uses Unicode by default for strings, which can reprsent a wider range of characters compared to ASCII. 
     

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHY do we use variable types?**</span>
* **answer 3:** Reasons:
* 1. **Data organization and movement:** Provides a way to organize and manage different kinds of data.
 2. **Memory allocation:** By specifying variable type, programming language can allocate appropriate amount of memory for the variable, optimizing memory usage.
 3.  **Data manipulation:** Variable types determine what operations and manipulations can be performed on the data. Different data types perform different functions.
 4. **Type safety:** Help ensure type safety in the program. By enforcing type of variable, programming language can enforce type checking during compilation or runtime, preventing unintended data conversions or operations.
 5. **Program readability:** Provide information to programmers and other readers of the code about the nature of the data being stored. This makes the code more readable and understandable, especially in large projects where multiple developers are involved.
