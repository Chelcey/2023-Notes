```

<span style="color:blue"> **Variable Assignment:**</span>

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHAT does variable assignment mean:**</span>
* **answer 1:** Process of storing a value in a variable. Allows us to give a name to a value and use that name to refer to the value thorughout the program. 

<span style="color:indigo"> **HOW do we apply variable assignment?**</span>
* **answer 2:** Follow these steps:
* 1. **Understand concept of variable assignment**, which is the process of assigning value to a variable. In Python, you can assign values to variables using assignment operator (=).
  2. **Choose variable name:** A name that is descriptive and meaningful. Can contain letters, numbers, but cannot start with number or contain spaces.
  3. **Assign a value to the variable:** Use assignment operator (=) to assign value to your variable. Value can be of any data type, i.e.) integers, text strings, or floating-point numbers.
 
 ```python
 x=10 #assigns the integer value 10 the variable `x`
```

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHY do we use variable assignment?**</span>
* **answer 3:** It is used to store and manipulate data. They are used to hold values and can be referenced and modified throughout a program. Reasons we use:
* 1. **Flexibility & Reusability**: allows us to store and reuse values across different parts of our program. Instead of hard-coding a value multiple times, we can assign it a variable and use that variable whenever we need it.
  2. **Data Manipulation**: Enables us to perform calculations and manipulate data. Can assign values to variables and use operators and functions to perform operations on those variables. Allows us to perform complex computations and process data in a more organized and efficient manner.
  3. **Readability**: Variables with descriptive names can make our code more readable and understandable. This makes it easier for other programmers (ourselves included) to understand and modify the code.
  4. **Dynamic Typing**: Not having to declare the type of a varaible explicitly. Variables can hold different types of values at different points in the program. Flexibility allows us to create more versatile and adaptable code.
  5. **Code Organization**: Helps in organizing our code by giving meaningful names to different values. We can group related values together and clearly express their purpose. Improves overall readability and maintainability of our code. 

  
```python
my_variable = 1 # `my_variable` is a variable

#This defines another variable
other_var = `variables are lit`
another_var = "this is also text"

#once you create a variable it's stored in your namespace
my_variable
```

```python
a = 29
a = `string`
print(a)
```
<span style="color:pink"> **After executing following code, what is the value of a?"**</span>
* **answer:** string

  
<span style="color:green"> **Reminder: Code Variables != Math Variables**</span>
* In mathematics: `=` refers to equality (statement of truth)
* In coding: `=` refers to assignment

<span style="color:blue"> **Reserved Words:**</span>
* There are 33 words not allowed to be used for variable assignment in Python >3.6
* 1. False
  2. class
  3. finally
  4. is
  5. return
  6. None
  7. continue
  8. for
  9. lambda
  10. try
  11. True
  12. def
  13. from
  14. nonlocal
  15. while
  16. and
  17. del
  18. global
  19. not
  20. with
  21. as
  22. elif
  23. if
  24. or
  25. yield
  26. assert
  27. else
  28. import
  29. pass
  30. break
  31. except
  32. in
  33. raise
 
  * Using a reserved word as a variable assignment will break Python
  * Names are always left of `=`, values are always on right
  * Names are case sensitive
  

<span style="color:blue"> **Variable Types**</span>

| Variable Type | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| String (str) | store characters, as text |
| Integer (int) | store signed, whole numbers |
| Float (float) | store signed, decimal-point numbers |
| Booleans (bool) | store `True` or `False` (capitalization matters) |
| None (NoneType) | special type that stores `None`, used to denote a null or empty value. |
| Lists (list) & Tuples (tup) | collection of ordered items, that can be of mixed type (lists are mutable; tuples are immutable) |
| Dictionaries (dict) | mutable collection of items, that can be of mixed-type, that are stored as key-value pairs. |

```python
# Declare a variable
variable_name = 1.342
variable_name2 = 3
variable_name3 = [1,3,5, 'crap', None, 4.242]

# Some Notes
# 1.342 is an example of a floating number
# 3 is an example of an integer
# None is a none type
# [1,3,5] is an example of a list

# You can always ask Python 'what type is this variable' using:
type(variable_name)
type(variable_name2)
type(variable_name3)
```

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHAT does variable types mean:**</span>
* **answer 1:** refers to the various categories or classifications of data that can be stored in a variable in a programming language. Can hold different types of values, i.e.) integers, texts, strings, floating-point numbers, boolean values, etc.

<span style="color:indigo"> **HOW do we apply variable types?**</span>
* **answer 2:** Steps to apply variable types:
* 1. **Specify type at time of declaration**
 ```python
my_variable = 10
```
Here, `my_variable` is an integer variable with a value of 10. 

  2. **Change the type during runtime:** Unlike other programming languages like Java and C, Python allows you to change the type of variable during runtime. I.e.) you can assign a different type of value to a variable that was previously assigned a different type of value.

```python
my_variable = 10 # my_variable is an integer
my_variable = "Hello" # Now my_variable is a string
```
Here, 'my_variable` starts as an integer and then gets assigned a string value. 

  3. **Be cautious with the assignment operator:** It's important to note taht the assignment operator (`=`) used in programming is not the same as the mathematical equal sign. Assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable, while the equal sign in mathematics reps equality. When applying variable types, ensure to use the assignment operator correctly.

  4. **Use descriptive variable names:** Crucial to avoid reserved words in Python programming langauage as variable names. Reserved words are words that have special meanings in Python and cannot be used as variable names.
  5. **Default types in Python:** Python has default types for variables. When you assign a value enclosed in quotes to a vriable, Python assumes it to be a string. If you assign a whole number to a variable, Python assumes it to be an integer. Python uses Unicode by default for strings, which can reprsent a wider range of characters compared to ASCII. 
     

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHY do we use variable types?**</span>
* **answer 3:** Reasons:
* 1. **Data organization and movement:** Provides a way to organize and manage different kinds of data.
 2. **Memory allocation:** By specifying variable type, programming language can allocate appropriate amount of memory for the variable, optimizing memory usage.
 3.  **Data manipulation:** Variable types determine what operations and manipulations can be performed on the data. Different data types perform different functions.
 4. **Type safety:** Help ensure type safety in the program. By enforcing type of variable, programming language can enforce type checking during compilation or runtime, preventing unintended data conversions or operations.
 5. **Program readability:** Provide information to programmers and other readers of the code about the nature of the data being stored. This makes the code more readable and understandable, especially in large projects where multiple developers are involved.

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHAT does operators mean:**</span>
* **answer 1:** refers to symbols or characters used in programming languages to perform specific oeprations on one or more operands. 

<span style="color:indigo"> **HOW do we apply operators?**</span>
* **answer 2:** Steps:
  
* 1. **Understand the different types of operators:** Python supports various types of operators, such as arithmetic operators, assignment operators, comparison operators, logical operators, logical operators, and more.
 
  2. **Arithmetic operators:**
     
     | Syntax | Description |
     | ----------- | ----------- |
     | Addition (+)| Adds two values together. |
     | Subtraction (-) | Subtracts one value from another. |

  6.   > **Important sentences**
       > When applying operators in Python, it is crucial to understand the order of operations, also known as operator precedence. This determines the sequence in which operators are     evaluated. Parentheses should be used to enforce the desired order of operations.
      
  7.   **Examples:**

     ```python
     # Applying arithmetic operators:
     # Addition:
     2 + 3 # evaluates to 5.
     # Multiplication:
     4 * 5 # evaluates to 20.
     # Division:
     10 / 2 # evaluates to 5.0 (floating-point division)
     # Modulo:
     10 % 3 # evaluates to 1 (remainder of 10 divided by 3).
     # Exponentiation:
     2 ** 3 # evaluates to 8 (2 raised to power of 3).

     # Applying comparision operators:
     # Equality:
     7 == 7 # evaluates to True
     # Greater than:
     10 > 5 # evaluates to True
     3 < 10 # evaluates to True

     #Applying logical operators:
     # Logical AND:
     True and False # evaluates to False
     # Logical OR:
     True or False # evaluates to True
     # Logical NOT
     not True # evaluates to False
     ```

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHY do we use operators?**</span>
* **answer 3:** To perform various operations on values and variables. Such as, performing mathematical operations, manipulating and comparing data, chanign the type of variable, and performing advanced operations.

<span style="color:green"> **Comparision Operator**</span>

| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|`==` | values are equal |
| `!=` | values are <span style="color:green">**not**</span> equal |
| `<` | value on left <span style="color:green">**is**</span> less than value <span style="color:green">**or**</span> right.  |
| `>` | value on left <span style="color:green">**is**</span> greater than value on right.  |
| `<=` | value on left <span style="color:green">**is**</span> less than <span style="color:red">* </span><span style="color:green">**or**</span> equal to<span style="color:red">*</span> value on right. |
| `>=` | value on left <span style="color:green">**is**</span> greater than <span style="color:green">**or**</span> equal to value on the right.  |

```python
a = 7
b = '7'
a == b
```

<span style="color:pink"> **After executing following code, how will the following expression evaluate?"**</span>
* **answer:** False


<span style="color:blue"> **Logical (Boolean) operators:** </span>
* use Boolean logic
* logical operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`
* named after British mathematician - George Boole
* Boole formulated Boolean algebra, which are a set of rules for how to reason with and combine these values. This is the basis of all modern computer logic.

```python
# AND
# will return True
# both sides evaluate as true
4 == 4 and 3 < 4

#outputs: True

# OR
# will return True
# one side evaluates as True
4 != 4 or 3 < 4

#outputs: True
```

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHAT does logical (boolean) operators mean:**</span>

* **answer 1:** used in programming to perform logical operations on boolean values. These operators allow us to combine multiple boolean values and evaluate the overall result.
  
  | Syntax | Description |
  | ----------- | ----------- |
  | `and` | True if both are true |
  | `or` | True if at least one is true |
  | `not` | True only if false |

<span style="color:indigo"> **HOW do we apply logical (boolean) operators?**</span>
* **answer 2:** Here are examples:
  ```python
x = 5
y = 10
z = 15
# Using the and operator
print(x < y and y < z) # Output: True
print(x < y and y > z) # Output: False
# Using the or operator
print(x < y or y < z) # Output: True
print(x > y or y > z) # Output: False
# Using the not operator
print(not x < y) # Output: False
print(not x > y) # Output: True
# Using logical operators with iterable data types
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
print(len(my_list) > 0 and 'a' in my_dict) # Output: True
print(len(my_list) == 0 or 'c' in my_dict) # Output: False
```

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHY do we use this?**</span>
* **answer 3:** We use it in programming to manipulate and compare boolean values. They allow us to combine multiple conditions and determine the overall truth value of a statement. 


<span style="color:blue"> **Conditionals:**</span> 
* `if`: checks a condition; using the `if` statement, and then only executes a set of code if the condition evaluates as `True`
* `elif`: after an `if` statement, you can have any number of `elif`s (meaning 'else if') to check other conditons.
* `else`: after an `if`, you can use an `else` that will run if the conditional(s) above have not run.

```python
## example
condition_1 = False
condition_2 = False

# if is required
if condition_1:
   print('This code executes if condition_1 evaluates as True.')
   print('something else too')
   print('another thing to print')
else:
   print('alternative')

print('something that will always be executed no matter what condition_1 value')
#whitespace is important (for if statements that how they work) 
```

<span style="color:green"> **Properties of conditionals:**</span> 
* All conditionals start with an `if`, you can have an optional and variable number of `elif`s and an optional `else` statement
* Conditonals can take any experession that can be evaluated as `True` or `False`.
* At most one component (`if`/ `elif` / `else`) of a conditonal will run
* The order of conditional blocks is always `if` then `elif`(s) then `else`
* Code is only ever executed if the condition is met. 

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHAT does conditionals mean:**</span>
* **answer 1:** refers to programming structures that allow the execution of specific code blocks based on certain conditions. These conditions are typically expressed through logical expressions and are used to control the flow of a program. 

<span style="color:indigo"> **HOW do we apply conditonals?**</span>
* **answer 2:** To apply conditionals in Python, you can use **if statements**. The general syntax of an if statement in Python:

  ```python
  if
   `condition`
  :
   `code block`
  ```

* Begin with the if statement with the keyword `if`.
* Inside parentheses, specify the condition that you want to evaluate. This condition can be a comparision or an expression that evaluates to either True or False.
* After the colon, indent the code block that will be executed if the condition is True. The code block is typically indented with four spaces.
* Write code you want to execute if the condition is true within the indented code block.

```python
# Example 1
num = -5

if num > 0:
print ("The number is positive")
else:
print("The number is negative")
```
*In this example, the condition `num > 0` is evaluates. If condition is True, then code block `print("the number is positive")` is executed. If condition is False, code block `print("The number is negative")` is executed. 

```python
# Example 2
num = 0

if num > 0:
print("The number is positive")
elif num < 0:
print("The number is negative")
else:
print("The number is zero")
```

* In this example, if the condition `num > 0` is True, code block `print("The number is positive") is executed. If the condition `num < 0` is True, the code block `print("The number is negative")` is executed. If both conditions are False, code block `print("The number is zero")` is executed. 

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHY do we use conditionals?**</span>
* **answer 3:** We use conditionals to make decisions and control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. 

<span style="color:blue"> **Loops:**</span>
* a procedure to repeat a piece of code.

 | Syntax | Description |
 | ----------- | ----------- |
 | `**while` loop** | repeat a piece of code while some condition is still met |
 | '**for` loop** | repeat code for every element in a sequence |

* `while` loops have the structure
```python
while condition:
  # Loop contents
```

* While condition is true, execute the code contents. Repeat until condition is no longer True.

* `for` loops follow the general structure:
  
```python
for item in iterable_variable:
  # Loop contents
```

* For each `item` in `iterable variable`, execute the code contents. Repeat until you reach last item in `iterable_variable`. 

```python
my_lst = [0, 1, 2, 3]
alistofstrings = ['hi', 'there', 'everyone']

for item in my_lst:
  print('for loop',item)
  if item % 2 == 0:
     print('if statement', item)
```


<span style="color:pink"> **After executing following code, what will the following loop print out?"**</span>
* **answer:** 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3
* <span style="color:red"> Unsure, because it was not one of the given answers. Ask about this...
  
<span style="color:indigo"> **WHAT does loops mean:**</span>
* **answer 1:** A fundamental programming concept that allows for the repetition of a set of instructions. 

<span style="color:indigo"> **HOW do we apply loops?**</span>
* **answer 2:** Steps:
  1. **Understanding loops**: Loops are used for repeating a set of instructions multiple times. There are 2 types in Python: `for` loop and `while` loop.
     
  2. **For loop**: The for loop is used when we know the number of iterations in advance. It is typically used for iterating over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string). The general syntax of a for loop is:

 ```python
for variable in sequence:
code block
```
- *variable* represents the current item in the *sequence* and is updated automatically in each iteration.
- *code block* represents the set of instructions that will be executed in each iteration.

  3. **While loop**: The while loop is used when we don't know the number of iterations in advance and want to repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met.

     ```python
     while condition:
     code block
     ```

     - The *condition* is a boolean expression that determines whether the loop should continue or not. It is evaluated before each iteration.
     - The *code block* represents the set of instructions that will be executed as long as the *condition* is true. 
     
  4. **Examples of loop applications**: The lecturer does not provide specific examples or code snippets demonstrating the application of loops in the lecture notes.

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHY do we use loops?**</span>
* **answer 3:** We use loops because:
* They repeat a set of instructions or actions multiple times without rewriting the code each time.
* They help achieve efficiency, automation, and iteration over data structures.
* Can be combined with conditional statements for conditional execution.
* Results in more concise and maintainable code.
