<span style="color:red"> **Resources and Tools:**</span>

- Python Data Science Handbook by Jake Vander Plas
- Git: a tool for source code control, similar to track changes in Microsoft office
- Github: used for collaboration and group proejcts
- Course materials and assignments can be found on Github and Data Hub
- Campus wire is recommended for communication with TAs and instructor

<span style="color:maroon"> **Lecture 02:**</span>

<span style="color:red"> **Jupyter notebooks:**</span>

- cell-based web interface used for programming
- New cells are code cells by default and program counter increments when a code is executed
- important to save regularly [command + save] to not lose progress
- run button is used to execute the current cell, can also run by pressing [shift + return]
- Interactive quizzes are used for active learning & to enhance understanding

<span style="color:red"> **Python Programming Basics:**</span>

<span style="color:forest green"> **2 Ways to get Output on the screen:**</span>
1. Print statement
   
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

2. Last line echo

```python
message = "This is a last line echo.
print(message)
```

<span style="color:blue"> **Variable Assignment:**</span>

<span style="color:indigo"> **What does variable assignment mean:**</span>
* **answer 1:** Process of storing a value in a variable. Allows us to give a name to a value and use that name to refer to the value thorughout the program. 

<span style="color:indigo"> **HOW do we apply variable assignment?**</span>
* **answer 2:** Follow these steps:
* 1. **Understand concept of variable assignment**, which is the process of assigning value to a variable. In Python, you can assign values to variables using assignment operator (=).
  2. **Choose variable name:** A name that is descriptive and meaningful. Can contain letters, numbers, but cannot start with number or contain spaces.
  3. **Assign a value to the variable:** Use assignment operator (=) to assign value to your variable. Value can be of any data type, i.e.) integers, text strings, or floating-point numbers.
 
 ```python
 x=10 #assigns the integer value 10 the variable `x`
```

<span style="color:indigo"> **WHY do we use this?**</span>
* **answer 3:** It is used to store and manipulate data. They are used to hold values and can be referenced and modified throughout a program. Reasons we use:
* 1. **Flexibility & Reusability**: allows us to store and reuse values across different parts of our program. Instead of hard-coding a value multiple times, we can assign it a variable and use that variable whenever we need it.
  2. **Data Manipulation**: Enables us to perform calculations and manipulate data. Can assign values to variables and use operators and functions to perform operations on those variables. Allows us to perform complex computations and process data in a more organized and efficient manner.
  3. **Readability**: Variables with descriptive names can make our code more readable and understandable. This makes it easier for other programmers (ourselves included) to understand and modify the code.
  4. **Dynamic Typing**: Not having to declare the type of a varaible explicitly. Variables can hold different types of values at different points in the program. Flexibility allows us to create more versatile and adaptable code.
  5. **Code Organization**: Helps in organizing our code by giving meaningful names to different values. We can group related values together and clearly express their purpose. Improves overall readability and maintainability of our code. 

  
```python
my_variable = 1 # `my_variable` is a variable

#This defines another variable
other_var = `variables are lit`

#once you create a variable it's stored in your namespace
my_variable
```

```python
a = 29
a = `string`
print(a)
```
